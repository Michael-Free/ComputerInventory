# ComputerInventory
This is a quick and dirty Powershell framework to perform a basic inventory of systems by polling the domain controller of all joined computers to that domain and collecting any relevant information about those computers/devices.  This includes gathering serial numbers, system specs, computer types, keyboards, mice, monitors, memory, storage capacity, storage type (HDD/SSD), hostnames, and other relevant system information.

Once the domain is polled for relevant system information, physical verification will need to be performed of systems detected, and systems that may not be connected to the domain controller, or unable to get relevant information in the first place.
